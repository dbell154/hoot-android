<h2>Power Searching</h2>
<p><strong class="red">Note:</strong> The Hoot Power Search (initially known as Multi Search) search screen is one where you can specify search criteria  on separate lines.
  Whereas the standard search screen uses select multiple criteria to generate a single database
  search, each line in this screen will be searched separately. As a result this search may be
  slower. This screen consists of a primary search line and additional criteria. The options in
  the primary search are limited somewhat, so the results will be progressively narrowed down.
  The additional criteria then narrow the primary search. If you don't enter anything for
  criteria searches that criteria will be ignored. Following are other elements of the multi
  search screen.</p>
<h3>Not box</h3>
<p> In the criteria you have the option to exclude the results from the primary search by checking the box.</p>
<h3>Add criteria</h3>
<p>You can add additional criteria by clicking on the plus sign next to the sorting options.</p>
<h3>Delete criteria</h3>
<p>Delete a criteria line by clicking on the minus sign next to the criteria.</p>
<h3>Sort Options</h3>
<p>Multi Search screen includes sort options below the criteria.</p>
<h3>Limit Options</h3>
<p>The ellipses next to the search button allows you to limit final output to a certain number of words, and starting at a certain position in the list. Unlike the standard search screen there is no speed advantage is setting word count limits.</p>
<h2>Speed Issues</h2>
<p>Most searches will complete in seconds, although less efficient searches could take 3-4 minutes or longer, and SEEM much longer. There is no way to cancel a search just yet so if a search is taking too long you may want to close the app from the recent apps screen. </p>
<p>The speed of the search depends on both the word count and search procedure. Ideally, the first search should narrow the search down the most. You may often find the narrowing by Length will be the easiest. Some of the searches in the criteria are slower than others and should be selected last. These are indicated with an hourglass at the end of the search name. </p>


<h3>Search Options</h3>
<p>The search options are mostly the same as in the main search screen. The search term contains the letters used to execute the  search. Some search types will allow
the use of special characters, such as in  a Pattern search, or show additional options or information. One exception is Hook Words where here it only means words that have hooks. </p>
<p>  You can use wildcards (?, *) in many searches.<br>
  The ? button is a simple way to enter a blank in the search  term if allowed.<br>
  The X button next to it simply clears the search term box.</p>
<h3>Primary Search Options</h3>
<p> <strong>Anagrams</strong> finds words with all the letters in the search box. Use a ? to
  indicate an unknown letter<br>
  <strong>Length</strong> (Length) shows words of the select length<br>
  <strong>Pattern</strong> searches based on a modified regular expression. Most searches can
  also be done using the  Pattern Search. For example, IN* will show words beginning with IN and
  *J* will show words that contain a J. See <a
          href="http://www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/help/pattern.html" target="_self">www
    .tylerhosting.com/hoot/help/pattern.html</a><br>
  <strong>Contains</strong> returns words that contain the entered term<br>
  <strong>Word Builder</strong> (subanagrams) searches for words that can be
  formed from any of the letters in the search terms.<br>
  <strong>Contains All</strong> (superanagrams) searches for words that  contain at least all
  of the letters in the search term.<br>
  <strong>Contains Any</strong> searches for words that contain any letter in  the search
  term. Entering JQXZ will shows words that contain one of these high scoring tiles.<br>
  <strong>Begins With</strong> displays word that begin with the selected or  entered
  beginning.<br>
  <strong>Ends With</strong> displays word that end with the selected or  entered beginning.<br>
  <strong>Predefined</strong> discussed below<br>
  <strong>From File</strong> displays valid words that are contained in a file. Select the file from the dialog box. </p>
<h3>Criteria Search Options</h3>
<p> <strong>Anagrams</strong> finds words with all the letters in the search box. Use a ? to
  indicate an unknown letter<br>
  <strong>Length</strong> (Length) shows words of the select length<br>
  <strong>Hook Words</strong> shows words that have  hooks.<br>
  <strong>Pattern</strong> searches based on a modified regular expression. Most searches can
  also be done using the  Pattern Search. For example, IN* will show words beginning with IN and
  *J* will show words that contain a J. See <a
          href="http://www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/help/pattern.html" target="_self">www
    .tylerhosting.com/hoot/help/pattern.html</a><br>
  <strong>Contains</strong> returns words that contain the entered term<br>
  <strong>Word Builder</strong> (subanagrams) searches for words that can be
  formed from any of the letters in the search terms.<br>
  <strong>Contains All</strong> (superanagrams) searches for words that  contain at least all
  of the letters in the search term.<br>
  <strong>Contains Any</strong> searches for words that contain any letter in  the search
  term. Entering JQXZ will shows words that contain one of these high scoring tiles.<br>
  <strong>Begins With</strong> displays word that begin with the selected or  entered
  beginning.<br>
  <strong>Ends With</strong> displays word that end with the selected or  entered beginning.<br>
  <strong>Takes Prefix</strong> displays words that can take the term as a prefix.<br>
  <strong>Takes Suffix</strong> displays words that can take the term as a suffix.<br>
  <strong>Alt Ending</strong> displays words that can take the alternate ending. Entering ED?ER
  will find words ending in ED that can alternately be spelled with ER.<br>
  <strong>Replace</strong> displays words where an alternate spelling exists within the word. Entering TTL?DDL will find words where TTL can be replace with DDL. <br>
<strong>From File</strong> displays valid words that are contained in a file. Select the file from the dialog box. </p>
<p><em><strong>Special Search Options</strong></em><br>
The last few options don't search directly. Instead, they  either provide lists to select from or
  an option for further searching.</p>

<p><strong>Predefined</strong><br>
  Predefined turns the search term into a dropdown list where  you can select the predefined
  list. Most predefined lists are self-explanatory.  Options that refer to Fours or Fives show
  that length word that begin or end  with a high point tile. Top fours begin or end with JQXZ.
  High fours begin or  end with four or five point tiles. Palindromes are words that are spelled
  the  same forward and back. Hookless Words do not take a hook, Unique Hooks take only one hook
  letter. Hooked Words have internal hooks.
  Semordnilaps are words that form a valid word when spelled forward or back (HEY, YEH). This one takes a while..</p>


<h2>Context Options</h2>
<h3>Subsearch Options</h3>
<p>  Subsearches are searches using a selected word in the  results. To execute, long press on
  the word and select the option from the  popup menu. Most of these options are the same as the
  regular search option. Additional options include
  <strong>Blank Anagrams</strong> searches for words that contain all letter in  the selected
  word plus a blank<br>

  A  few additional options available under the submenu Other... include<br>
  <strong>Misspells</strong> searches for words that have one letter different  from the selected
  word<br>
  <strong>Transpositions</strong> searches for words that have two letters  transposed<br>
  <strong>Stretches</strong> searches for words that have a letter inserted  into the selected
  word<br>
  <strong>Joins</strong> shows words joined by the selected word.<br>

  Tip: In order to sort in the subsearch screen, select  sorting options before subsearching.</p>

<h3>List Options</h3>
<p>Below the subsearches are options that apply to the whole list of results. <br>
  <strong>Save List</strong> allows you to save the results to a text file. The location defaults to the Documents folder in  internal storage. <br>
    <strong>Copy List</strong> allows you to copy the results to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere.<br>
<strong>Add to Card Box...</strong> lets you add the results to one of the card boxes. See Card Quizzes below for more information. </p>
<h2>Slides and Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Lists displayed in the Search screen and Subsearches can be used to show slides, quiz reviews,
  and quizzes by selecting the buttons at the bottom of the screen. <br>
  <strong>Slides</strong> show each word, and can be displayed on a timer. With all three you can
  navigate to the first, previous,
  next, or last slide, or select the word/alphagram from the list.<br>
  <strong>Quiz Review</strong> displays one of three types of lists. Anagrams shows the alphagram
  at the
    top and all anagrams below using the same format as the search screen, sans stats. Other
  options are Hook Words, and Blank Anagrams. <br>
  <strong>Quiz</strong> options include List Recall, Anagrams, Hook Words, and Blank Anagrams.
  The anagram quiz will show the alphagram and quizzes the user for each anagram. Press the letters
  to add it to the answer. There is a shuffle button to the left, and the display button or next
  button on the right.
  The other quizzes provide a custom keyboard to enter the letters for each quiz item.
  For the List Recall Quiz you can start the quiz without first showing the words in the search.
  Enter the parameters and select Quiz > List Recall, instead of Search.
  <em>Note:</em>A blank anagram (as used in Hoot) is a word built from a term plus a blank
  letter. For example, ANESTRI is a blank anagram of the bingo stem TISANE.
</p>
<h2>Card Quizzes</h2>
<p>Card quizzes are new in Hoot and two steps are required to begin using this feature. </p>
<p>First, you must add words to a card quiz box. This is done by doing a search, long pressing on
  the search results, and selecting the box option. The Anagrams and Hooks boxes are standard in
  Zyzzyva. Hoot also has Blank Anagrams (think stems) as an option, and Lists. With lists, you
  are saving to a dedicated card box for that search, and you again have the option to select
  Anagrams, Hooks, or Blank Anagrams, and give the list a name.</p>
<p>Secondly, you have to go to the Card Boxes item in the Options Menu (three dots). You can take
  the quiz in the scheduled order, or in Cardbox Order.  Randomize shuffles the order of cards
  that are scheduled near the same time (within a 10 hour
  span). Without randomize the cards within a card box appear in tha same order each time and may
  be too predictable, especially if added in alphabetical order.

  Take the quiz by selecting the letters (Anagrams), or typing them in the keyboard. When you provide all the
  correct answers, the Arrow button displayed takes you to the next item. <br />

  Tile dragging
  routines are still under development. Other than using the shuffle button in
  Anagrams, there is currently no way to rearrange the letters displayed.  </p>
<p>Select what you want to add to card boxes carefully since there is no card management feature
  in Hoot. You can, however, delete the card box from the file system and start over if you want.
  You can however delete card boxes in Lists from the Card box menu. You can also copy
  Anagrams or Hooks card boxes from Zyzzyva. The card boxes are located in Emulated storage on
  your device under Documents\Cards\&lt;Lexicon&gt;\&lt;type&gt;.db, unless you select to use
  Internal. If Internal, users do not have access to the databases. Devices running Android 11 and
  later must use Internal.</p>

<h3>Flashcard mode</h3>
<p>By enabling flashcard mode in Settings you can speed through cards faster. In this mode you
  mentally find the answers to the quiz, then tap the list area to show the correct answers.
  Swipe up to register it as correct or swipe down to register it as incorrect. Be careful not to
  attempt to scroll by swiping; use the scrollbar.</p>

<h3>Filter and Merge</h3>
<p>When selecting a card quiz you can now filter the card box to study a subset of the cards.
  Enter search criteria at the bottom, check the box, and select either Quiz or Review. Keep in
  mind that only those words that are in the card box will be shown if you had previously added
  them. Using the filter doesn't change the order in which they are presented.</p>
<p>You can now also merge words in a list card box into the respective standard card box. That
  adds the correct count, box number, and sets the scheduled date to the latter of both card
  boxes. So you can use a list to study RETINA? anagrams until you have learned them and then
  merge them into Anagrams with the other words. Merging doesn't change when they were scheduled
  to be tested again.</p>

<h2>Options Menu</h2>
<p>The option menu contains the basic settings, some tools, and information.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p> The settings menu available from the options menu enables  you to specify search options and
  select different databases or lexicons.</p>
<p><strong>Database</strong> lets you select an alternate database that is  stored in internal
  storage (emulated SD).<br>
  <strong>Card Location</strong> lets you select the location of card box databases, either
  Internal or Storage. Only Internal is available for Android 11 and later.<br>
  <strong>Lexicon</strong> lets you select a different lexicon in the database.<br>
  <strong>Tile Set</strong> used by pattern searches for point value patterns.  The pattern
  search 8* will show all words that begin with a 8 point tile. This  is also used when
  configuring or importing a lexicon to calculate the scores  that are stored in that lexicon.<br>
  <strong>Word length preference</strong> limits search to words of this length  or shorter. Many
  search tools use 10 or 12 letter words.<br>
  <strong>List size limit</strong> limits the number of results returned. Set to 0 for no limit.
  <strong>Find on tapping</strong> allows you to select an alternate to definitions when tapping
  on a word in the results.<br>
  <strong>Display name</strong> lets you enter your username. Currently it has no other purpose.

  <h4>Display Options</h4>
  <strong>Condensed Display</strong> limits the on-screen specifications to two lines. Other
specifications can be entered by clicking on the ellipsis. Don't forget about entering something
here.<br>
  <strong>Show rack filter</strong> filters the list to include words playable with only the
letters entered here.<br>
  <strong>Show hooks in list</strong> enables the display of hook letters and inner hook symbols
for each word.<br>
  <strong>Show stats in list</strong> enables the display of number of  anagrams, probability,
and playability in the results in addition to the word  score.<br>
  <strong>Color blanks</strong> enables blanks to be displayed in a different color in Anagrams,
Blank Anagrams, Stems, and Word Builder.<br>
  <strong>List font size</strong> enable you to change the size of words in the list. Hook
letters and definitions sizes are adjusted accordingly.<br>
  <strong>Fast scroll</strong> enables fast scroll which includes clicking to jump to a position
in the list.<br>
  <strong>Custom Keyboard</strong> enables the use of Hoot's custom keyboards, depending on the
search type. Pattern searches will show a comprehensive keyboard while other searches will show
the basic keyboard.
  <strong>Tile Color</strong> sets the color of tiles displayed in slides and quizzes.
  <strong>Color theme</strong> sets the theme for search activities in the app. Dark theme will
use less power and may save battery use.<br>

<h4>Slides and Quiz Options</h4>
  <strong>Auto advance in Quiz</strong> will go to the next word after answering all quiz items
successfully.<br>
  <strong>Enable Flashcard mode</strong> will enable flashcards in Card Box quizzes. Tap to show
answers, swipe up or down for correct or incorrect.<br>
  <strong>Default number of cards</strong> in card quiz. To show all cards scheduled, enter 0.<br>

  <strong>Loop in Slides</strong> will go to the first item after the last item is displayed.<br>
  <strong>Keep Screen On</strong> prevents the screen from sleeping while you are in Slides or
Tile Tracker.<br>
<strong>Show Hooks in Quiz</strong> will show hooks in results as you take the quiz. Normally
this is turned off so the hooks don't help you find answers. <br>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p> There are now several tools in Hoot:  Word Judge, Lookup, Import Subject List, Import
  Lexicon, Copy Internal Database,
  Add Alphagrams (temp), Tile Tracker, and Time Clock..<br>
  <strong>Word Judge</strong> is a separate screen that judges plays based on  Scrabble rules.
  This tool can also be run from a separate shortcut app.To validate a play enter words separated
  by spaces or new lines and when complete press Judge.<br>
  <strong>Lookup</strong> is the casual lookup of a single word. It will show  whether it's
  valid, and if available, the definition of the word.<br>
  <strong>Import Subject List</strong> lets you add your own subject lists to the database. Words
  will only be displayed in search if valid. Imported text files recognize several tags at the
  top of the file that begin with // including List Name:, List Source:, List Credits:, List
  Description:, and List Category:
<br>
  <strong>Import Lexicon</strong> enables app users to import a Hoot version 3  lexicon. Some
  lexicons can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/downloads.html"
                                     target="_blank">www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/downloads
    .html</a>, including ENABLE (early  Words with Friends) and ODS5 (older French). <br>
Desktop users can create custom lexicons and then export them to be used in the app, or  by
  other Hoot users. Note that Hoot may not permit you to export a lexicon of  some copyrighted
  wordlists.<br>
  <strong></strong><strong>Copy Internal Database</strong> copies the distributed database to the
  Documents folder
  in internal storage. This database can be used to modify the program by adding other lexicons.
  <br>
  <strong>Add Alphagrams to Old Lexicon</strong> modifies an existing database to add another
  column so the results can be sorted by alphagrams. Distributed databases already include the
  extra column, so this is seldom needed.<br>
  <strong>Tile Tracker</strong> displays a tile tracker that you might want to use when playing a
game.
  <br>
<strong>Time Clock</strong> is a time clock for Scrabble. Features of the clock include the ability to execute Word Judge from the Timer, pause or reset, and change player names and time limit. </p>
