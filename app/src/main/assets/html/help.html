<h2>Searching (Standard Search)</h2>
<p>The Hoot search screen enables you to specify multiple  criteria for each search. The
  functioning of some controls will differ  depending on the search option selected.<br>
The first control is the search type which determines the  results displayed. For example, the
Anagram search will find words that can be  formed by rearranging the letters entered. All of the available search options are listed below. If the keyboard is showing, you may have to scroll to see all of the options.<br>
The drop downs at the top right allows you to specify the  lengths of words to find.</p>
<p>  The search term contains the letters used to execute the  search. Some search types will allow
  the use of special characters, such as in  a Pattern search, or show additional options or information.<br>
  You can use wildcards (?, *) in many searches.<br>
  The ? button is a simple way to enter a blank in the search  term if allowed.<br>
  The X button next to it simply clears the search term box.<br>
  The ellipsis (three dots) to the right opens a dialog box to enter additional specifications. If condensed display is not enabled the other specifications are shown directly on the search screen.
</p>

<h3>Other Specifications</h3>
<p>  Begins with and Ends with filters allow you to select the  prefix or suffix for the respective
  search options. If using the  begins with, or ends with search type and the term is not in the
  drop down list, you can enter  it as the search term. <br>
  These filters can also be used in conjunction with other  searches so you can search for
  anagrams of REPRAISE ending in ER.
</p>
<p>There are two sorting options available. Select them before
  pressing Search.
One useful sort option is Alphagrams. This is particularly useful when studying stems. With
  Alphagrams as the primary Sort by, results are sorted by the letter added to the base letters,
  thus keeping anagrams together.
</p>
<p>Entering letters in the rack filter field will limit the list to words that can be made from
  these letters. This is normally what you have on your rack, but if you are playing through
  another letter, you need to add that letter too. </p>
<p>You can limit the number of results displayed and what number it starts with. For example,
  you could display the first 100, starting at 1, or 100 items starting at 301.</p>
  
  <p>Note: If you enter these additional specifications don't forget about them. If you don't get the results you expected check here.</p>
  
<p>At the top of the primary search screen there is now an arrow at the top that lets you show/hide the
  entry fields. This may be helpful after you have completed the search and want more room to peruse the results. </p>
<p>On each search screen there are also buttons at the bottom right that lets you clear all specifications, or open a new
  search window. </p>

<h3>Search Options</h3>

<p> Some options have an hourglass following the option. These will take longer to complete so you may want to narrow it down by specifying lengths, etc.
  There may be several ways to conduct the same search so you can  use the one that is most
  intuitive to you. <br>
  <strong>Anagrams</strong> finds words with all the letters in the search box. Use a ? to
  indicate an unknown letter<br>
  <strong>Length</strong> (Length) shows words of the select length<br>
  <strong>Hook Words</strong> shows words formed by adding a letter to the  beginning or end.
  Note: You can also search words of a certain length that have  hooks.<br>
  <strong>Pattern</strong> searches based on a modified regular expression. Most searches can
  also be done using the  Pattern Search. For example, IN* will show words beginning with IN and
  *J* will show words that contain a J. See <a
          href="http://www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/help/pattern.html" target="_self">www
    .tylerhosting.com/hoot/help/pattern.html</a><br>
  <strong>Contains</strong> returns words that contain the entered term<br>
  <strong>Word Builder</strong> (subanagrams) searches for words that can be
  formed from any of the letters in the search terms.<br>
  <strong>Contains All</strong> (superanagrams) searches for words that  contain at least all
  of the letters in the search term.<br>
  <strong>Contains Any</strong> searches for words that contain any letter in  the search
  term. Entering JQXZ will shows words that contain one of these high scoring tiles.<br>
  <strong>Begins With</strong> displays word that begin with the selected or  entered
  beginning.<br>
  <strong>Ends With</strong> displays word that end with the selected or  entered beginning.<br>
  <strong>Subwords</strong> displays subwords in the search term<br>
  <strong>Parallel</strong> displays words that can be played parallel to the  search term with
  one letter variance<br>
  <strong>Joins</strong> displays words where the term can join two other words<br>
  <strong>Takes Prefix</strong> displays words that can take the term as a prefix.<br>
  <strong>Takes Suffix</strong> displays words that can take the term as a suffix.<br>
  <strong>Alt Ending</strong> displays words that can take the alternate ending. Entering ED?ER
  will find words ending in ED that can alternately be spelled with ER.<br>
  <strong>Replace</strong> displays words that where letters on the left can replace letters on the right of the search term. Entering OUS?IOUS
  will find words containing OUS that can alternately be spelled with IOUS.<br>
  <strong>From File</strong> displays valid words that are contained in a file. Select the file from the dialog box. </p>

<p><em><strong>Special Search Options</strong></em><br>
  The last few options don't search directly. Instead, they  either provide lists to select from or
  an option for further searching.</p>

<p><strong>Stems</strong><br>
  The option for Stems changes the search term box to a drop  down where you can select the type of
  stem. When you select a type and Search  the list will show all the stems for that type.
  Tapping on one of the stems  will show the words that can be formed from that stem. That list
  also has all  the options available from the subsearch menu described below.</p>

<p><strong>Predefined</strong><br>
  Predefined turns the search term into a dropdown list where  you can select the predefined
  list. Most predefined lists are self-explanatory.  Options that refer to Fours or Fives show
  that length word that begin or end  with a high point tile. Top fours begin or end with JQXZ.
  High fours begin or  end with four or five point tiles. Palindromes are words that are spelled
  the  same forward and back. Hookless Words do not take a hook, Unique Hooks take only one hook
  letter. Hooked Words have internal hooks.
  Semordnilaps are words that form a valid word when spelled forward or back (HEY, YEH). This one takes a while.</p>

<p><strong>Subject Lists</strong><br>
  Subject lists are collections of words on different  subjects. They are grouped by category.
  When searching the category, the list of  subjects is displayed. Select one to see the words.</p>

<h2>Power Searching</h2>
<p><strong class="red">Note:</strong> The Hoot Power Search (initially known as Multi Search) search screen is one where you can specify search criteria  on separate lines.
  Whereas the standard search screen uses select multiple criteria to generate a single database
  search, each line in this screen will be searched separately. As a result this search may be
  slower. This screen consists of a primary search line and additional criteria. </p>
  <p>The options in
  the primary search are limited somewhat, so that the results will be progressively narrowed down.
  The additional criteria then narrow the primary search. If you don't enter anything for
  criteria searches that criteria will be ignored. Following are other elements of the multi
  search screen.</p>
<h3>Not box</h3>
<p> In the criteria you have the option to exclude the results from the primary search by checking the box.</p>
<h3>Add criteria</h3>
<p>You can add additional criteria by clicking on the plus sign next to the sorting options.</p>
<h3>Delete criteria</h3>
<p>Delete a criteria line by clicking on the minus sign next to the criteria.</p>
<h3>Sort Options</h3>
<p>Multi Search screen includes sort options below the criteria.</p>
<h3>Limit Options</h3>
<p>The ellipses next to the search button allows you to limit final output to a certain number of words, and starting at a certain position in the list. Unlike the standard search screen there is no speed advantage is setting word count limits.</p>
<h2>Speed Issues</h2>
<p>Most searches will complete in seconds, although less efficient searches could take 3-4 minutes or longer, and SEEM much longer. There is no way to cancel a search just yet so if a search is taking too long you may want to close the app from the recent apps screen. </p>
<p>The speed of the search depends on both the word count and search procedure. Ideally, the first search should narrow the search down the most. You may often find the narrowing by Length will be the easiest. Some of the searches in the criteria are slower than others and should be selected last. These are indicated with an hourglass at the end of the search name. </p>
<h3>Search Options</h3>
<p>The search options are mostly the same as in the main search screen. The search term contains the letters used to execute the  search. Some search types will allow
  the use of special characters, such as in  a Pattern search, or show additional options or information. One exception is Hook Words where here it only means words that have hooks. </p>
<p>  You can use wildcards (?, *) in many searches.<br>
  The ? button is a simple way to enter a blank in the search  term if allowed.<br>
  The X button next to it simply clears the search term box.</p>
<h3>Primary Search Options</h3>
<p> <strong>Anagrams</strong> finds words with all the letters in the search box. Use a ? to
  indicate an unknown letter<br>
  <strong>Length</strong> (Length) shows words of the select length<br>
  <strong>Pattern</strong> searches based on a modified regular expression. Most searches can
  also be done using the  Pattern Search. For example, IN* will show words beginning with IN and
  *J* will show words that contain a J. See <a
          href="http://www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/help/pattern.html" target="_self">www
    .tylerhosting.com/hoot/help/pattern.html</a><br>
  <strong>Contains</strong> returns words that contain the entered term<br>
  <strong>Word Builder</strong> (subanagrams) searches for words that can be
  formed from any of the letters in the search terms.<br>
  <strong>Contains All</strong> (superanagrams) searches for words that  contain at least all
  of the letters in the search term.<br>
  <strong>Contains Any</strong> searches for words that contain any letter in  the search
  term. Entering JQXZ will shows words that contain one of these high scoring tiles.<br>
  <strong>Begins With</strong> displays word that begin with the selected or  entered
  beginning.<br>
  <strong>Ends With</strong> displays word that end with the selected or  entered beginning.<br>
  <strong>Predefined</strong> discussed below<br>
  <strong>From File</strong> displays valid words that are contained in a file. Select the file from the dialog box. </p>

<a name="results" id="results"></a>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>  The results of searches are shown with the score at the  right margin. If selected in
  Settings other stats are also shown.<br>
  The first column on the left shows the number of anagrams.  The second column on the left shows
  the probability factor. Probability is shown as a  score, with the most probably being 100 and
  the least probable being 1.<br>
  The first column on the right shows the playability, which is  also shown as a score from 1 to
  100, next to the score column as recorded in the database.<br>
  Touching a word in the results will show the definition of  the word if available, or an
  alternate option you can select in Settings.<br>
  Long pressing on a word will show a list of subsearch  options as listed below. When selecting
  one a new list of words is shown for  that word based on the option selected.</p>

<a href="#top">Top</a>





		<a name="context" id="context"></a>
<h2>Context Options</h2>
<p>
To access context options long press on
  the word or list and select the option from the  popup menu
Context options will either execute subsearches based on the list of word selected or enable you to do something with the entire list.</p>

<h3>Subsearch Options</h3>
<p>  Subsearches are searches using a selected word in the  results. Most of these options are the same as the
  regular search option. Additional options include
  <strong>Blank Anagrams</strong> searches for words that contain all letter in  the selected
  word plus a blank<br>

  A  few additional options available under the submenu Other... include<br>
  <strong>Misspells</strong> searches for words that have one letter different  from the selected
  word<br>
  <strong>Transpositions</strong> searches for words that have two letters  transposed<br>
  <strong>Stretches</strong> searches for words that have a letter inserted  into the selected
  word<br>
  <strong>Joins</strong> shows words joined by the selected word.<br>

  Tip: In order to sort in the subsearch screen, select  sorting options before subsearching.</p>

<h3>List Options</h3>
<p>Below the subsearches are options that apply to the whole list of results. <br>
  <strong>Save List</strong> allows you to save the results to a text file. The location defaults to the Documents folder in  internal storage. <br>
    <strong>Copy List</strong> allows you to copy the results to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere.<br>
<strong>Add to Card Box...</strong> lets you add the results to one of the card boxes. See Card Quizzes below for more information. </p>
<h2>Slides and Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Lists displayed in the Search screen and Subsearches can be used to show slides, quiz reviews,
  and quizzes by selecting the buttons at the bottom of the screen. <br>
  <strong>Slides</strong> show each word, and can be displayed on a timer. With all three you can
  navigate to the first, previous,
  next, or last slide, or select the word/alphagram from the list.<br>
  <strong>Quiz Review</strong> displays one of three types of lists. Anagrams shows the alphagram
  at the
    top and all anagrams below using the same format as the search screen, sans stats. Other
  options are Hook Words, and Blank Anagrams. <br>
  <strong>Quiz</strong> options include List Recall, Anagrams, Hook Words, and Blank Anagrams.
  The anagram quiz will show the alphagram and quizzes the user for each anagram. Press the letters
  to add it to the answer. There is a shuffle button to the left, and the display button or next
  button on the right.
  The other quizzes provide a custom keyboard to enter the letters for each quiz item.
  For the List Recall Quiz you can start the quiz without first showing the words in the search.
  Enter the parameters and select Quiz > List Recall, instead of Search.
  <em>Note:</em>A blank anagram (as used in Hoot) is a word built from a term plus a blank
  letter. For example, ANESTRI is a blank anagram of the bingo stem TISANE.
</p>

		<a name="quizzes" id="quizzes"></a>
<h2>Card Quizzes</h2>
<p>Two steps are required to begin using card quizzes. </p>
<p>First, you must add words to a card quiz box. This is done by doing a search, long pressing on
  the search results, and selecting the card box option. The Anagrams and Hooks boxes are standard in
  Zyzzyva. Hoot also has Blank Anagrams (think stems) as an option, and Lists. With lists, you
  are saving to a dedicated card box for that search, and you again have the option to select
  Anagrams, Hooks, or Blank Anagrams, and give the list a name.</p>
<p>Secondly, you have to go to the Card Boxes item in the Options Menu (three dots). You can take
  the quiz in the scheduled order, or in Cardbox Order.  Randomize shuffles the order of cards
  that are scheduled near the same time (within a 10 hour
  span). Without randomize the cards within a card box appear in tha same order each time and may
  be too predictable, especially if added in alphabetical order.

  Take the quiz by selecting the letters (Anagrams), or typing them in the keyboard. When you provide all the
  correct answers, the Arrow button displayed takes you to the next item. <br />

  Tile dragging
  routines are still under development. Other than using the shuffle button in
  Anagrams, there is currently no way to rearrange the letters displayed.  </p>
<p>A separate help file is provided for cardbox <a href="cardboxhelp.html">here</a>, and can also be accessed from the card box screen.</p>

<p>Select what you want to add to card boxes carefully since there is no card management feature
  in Hoot. You can, however, delete the card box from the file system and start over if you want.
  You can however delete card boxes in Lists from the Card box menu. In older versions of Android you can also copy
  Anagrams or Hooks card boxes from Zyzzyva. The card boxes are located in Emulated storage on
  your device under Documents\Cards\&lt;Lexicon&gt;\&lt;type&gt;.db, unless you select to use
  Internal. If Internal, users do not have access to the databases. Devices running Android 11 and
  later must use Internal.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<a href="#top">Top</a>


		<a name="option" id="options"></a>
<h2>Options Menu</h2>
<p>The option menu lets you access power search, card boxes, some tools, the basic settings, and information.</p>

<h3>Power Search</h3>
<p>Power Search is a criteria based search screen. With it you can select up to 8 lines of custom
  criteria to use to search the word list. See the help from the option menu in that screen.</p>
  
<h3>Card Boxes </h3>
<p>Card Boxes opens the menu to select card box quizzes.</p>

<h3>Time Clock</h3>
<p>Time Clock is a timer for Scrabble. Features of the clock include the ability to execute Word Judge from the Timer, pause or reset, and change player names and time limit.</p>

<h3>Word Judge </h3>
<p>Word Judge is a separate screen that judges plays based on  Scrabble rules. To validate a play enter words separated
  by spaces or new lines and when complete press Judge.</p>
  
<h3>Lookup</h3>
<p>Lookup is the casual lookup of a single word. It will show  whether it's
  valid, and if available, the definition of the word. It will also show in what installed lexicons it is valid.</p>
  	
<h3>Time Clock </h3>
<p>The time clock allows you to use your device as a time clock. It begind with the standard time preset. You can enter names for the players, set a different time limit and pause for word judge. You can view the help file from the time clock screen.</p>

<h3>Tile Tracker </h3>
<p>Tile Tracker displays a visual display of Scrabble tiles that you can check off when playing a  game. </p>
  	
  
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>A separate help file is provided for Tools. 
<p><a href="toolguide.html">here</a>
<p>Most of the things in this menu are now for lexicon, card box, and database management.
  
<h4>Card box copying</h4>
When updating or changing lexicons you may want to transfer your card boxes to the new lexicon. These options allow you to do that for the current lexicons available.

<h4>Subject list management</h4>
Import Subject List lets you add your own subject lists to the database. Words
  will only be displayed in search if valid. Imported text files recognize several tags at the
  top of the file that begin with // including List Name:, List Source:, List Credits:, List
  Description:, and List Category: 
In addition to being able to import your own lists of words you can now delete lists or export them to share with others.

<h4>Lexicon management</h4>
Import Lexicon enables app users to import a Hoot version 3  lexicon. Some
  lexicons can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/downloads.html"
                                     target="_blank">www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/downloads
    .html</a>, including ENABLE (early  Words with Friends) and ODS5 (older French). <br>
  Desktop users can create custom lexicons and then export them to be used in the app, or  by
  other Hoot users. Note that Hoot may not permit you to export a lexicon of  some copyrighted
  wordlists.<br>The ability to add custom lexicons has been there for some time. Now you can delete lexicons. When deleting lexicons the table is only marked for deletion. To recover the space you have to compact the database.

<h4>Database management</h4>

Copy Internal Database copies the distributed database to the
  Documents folder
  in internal storage. This database can be used to modify the program by adding other lexicons. <br>

</p>
<h3>Settings</h3>

<p> The settings menu available from the options menu enables  you to specify search options and
  select different databases or lexicons.</p>
<p><strong>Database</strong> lets you select an alternate database. Users of older versions of Android can select databases that are stored in internal
  storage (emulated SD). In order to use an alternate database in newer versions of Android the database must be stored in internal memory. A separate tool allows you to import database into internal memory.<br>
  <strong>Card Location</strong> lets you select the location of card box databases, either
  Internal or Storage. Only Internal is available for Android 11 and later.<br>
  <strong>Lexicon</strong> lets you select a different lexicon in the database.<br>
  <strong>Tile Set</strong> used by pattern searches for point value patterns.  The pattern
  search 8* will show all words that begin with a 8 point tile. This is also used by time tracker.
This  is also used when
  configuring or importing a lexicon to calculate the scores  that are stored in that lexicon but once a lexicon is imported the word scores are set and not affected by the tile set selected.<br>
  <strong>Word length preference</strong> limits search to words of this length  or shorter. Many
  search tools use 10 or 12 letter words.<br>
  <strong>List size limit</strong> limits the number of results returned. Set to 0 for no limit.<br>
  <strong>On Alt Ending Show</strong> allows you select whether to show original or replacement word in Alt Ending and Replace searches.<br>
  <strong>Find on tapping</strong> allows you to select an alternate to definitions when tapping
  on a word in the results.<br>
  <strong>Display name</strong> lets you enter your username. Currently it has no other purpose.

  <h4>Display Options</h4>
  <strong>Condensed Display</strong> limits the on-screen specifications to two lines. Other
specifications can be entered by clicking on the ellipsis. Don't forget about entering something
here.<br>
  <strong>Show hooks in list</strong> enables the display of hook letters and inner hook symbols
for each word.<br>
  <strong>Show stats in list</strong> enables the display of number of  anagrams, probability,
and playability in the results in addition to the word  score.<br>
  <strong>Color blanks</strong> enables blanks to be displayed in a different color in Anagrams,
Blank Anagrams, Stems, and Word Builder.<br>
  <strong>List font size</strong> enable you to change the size of words in the list. Hook
letters and definitions sizes are adjusted accordingly.<br>
  <strong>Fast scroll</strong> enables fast scroll which includes clicking to jump to a position
in the list.<br>
  <strong>Custom Keyboard</strong> enables the use of Hoot's custom keyboards, depending on the
search type. Pattern searches will show a comprehensive keyboard while other searches will show
the basic keyboard.
  <strong>Tile Color</strong> sets the color of tiles displayed in slides and quizzes.
  <strong>Color theme</strong> sets the theme for search activities in the app. Dark theme will
use less power and may save battery use.<br>

<h4>Slides and Quiz Options</h4>
  <strong>Auto advance in Quiz</strong> will go to the next word after answering all quiz items
successfully.<br>
  <strong>Enable Flashcard mode</strong> will enable flashcards in Card Box quizzes. Tap to show
answers, swipe up or down for correct or incorrect.<br>
  <strong>Default number of cards</strong> in card quiz. To show all cards scheduled, enter 0.<br>

  <strong>Loop in Slides</strong> will go to the first item after the last item is displayed.<br>
  <strong>Keep Screen On</strong> prevents the screen from sleeping while you are in Slides or
Tile Tracker.<br>
<strong>Show Hooks in Quiz</strong> will show hooks in results as you take the quiz. Normally
this is turned off so the hooks don't help you find answers. <br>

<h3>Help</h3>
<p>You probably used that to get to this screen.</p>
<h3>About...</h3>
<p>Information about the program, me, and the lexicons distributed with Hoot.</p>
<h3>Exit</h3>
<p>Closes all activities and exits</p>
<h3>Hoot desktop companion</h3>
<p>  ------------<br>
  This app is a companion to the desktop program Hoot Lite.  The desktop version also lets you  create your own lexicon from a plain text
  word list, add definitions, and other things. <br>
  Using the desktop version you can also create databases that can be used in the  Android app.
