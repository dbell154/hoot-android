<p>This  app is a companion to the desktop program Hoot Lite. Using the  desktop version you can create databases with additional lexicons  that can be used in the Android app.
Importable  lexicons and Databases are available for download from the website www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/downloads.html,  including ENABLE (early Words with Friends) and ODS5 (French). The  desktop version also lets you create your own lexicon from a plain  text word list.<br/>

<h4>About  Me</h4>
<p>I  am a programmer with experience with numerous languages and most of  my programming was before I got a degree in the computer science  field. I  entered the field in the 1980's, about the time the PC (personal  computer) was first made readily available. Since  then, I've written in various versions of Basic, Visual Basic, C,  Pascal, Java, and other languages. I  also design websites and am familiar with HTML, CSS, PHP, Perl,  ASP.NET, Javascript, and others. I've also done a lot of other  computer type things. I didn't get a computer degree until 2012.</p>
<p>Before  starting this project, C# was one of the languages I was least  proficient in. I decided to develop PC version in C# after I  didn't get a C# programming job I had applied for. At  the time I was just getting more interested in word games so I  decided to make this my C# training project. Since then I've found Hoot so useful I wanted an Android app with some of the features I used, so I learned a lot more about Android development. I  also have a degree in accounting, having written a tax accounting  book or two, and do some graphic design. You  can see my website, blog, and outdated resume, at  <a href="http://www.tylerhosting.com/dbell/">www.tylerhosting.com/dbell/</a> and send me an email using one of the  contact forms. For recreation, I also enjoy playing disc golf.</p>
