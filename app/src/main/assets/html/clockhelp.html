<h2>Clock Help</h2>
<p>
  The Hoot Time Clock is designed for Club and Tournament Play and the controls are designed to conform to Scrabble tournament rules. It is part of the word study app, Hoot. Simply select the options on the main screen and select Time Clock from the menu. Currently it is under Tools. There may also be an icon in the app drawer that can open the Time Clock directly if Hoot is not already running.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>To begin using the clock, use the Settings button (gear icon) to enter the players' names, and set the time. The time defaults to the standard 25 minutes per player. Although not required, entering the player names is a good idea since it is so easy to turn the clock around. </p>
<p>When ready to start a new game, press and hold the center red button to reset the time if necessary. Entering settings doesn't stop the clock.</p>
<h3>Game Play</h3>
<p>The main sections of the time clock show the time remaining. If the time shown is either green or red, the clock is running. It is grey if not running.</p>
<p>To start a game, the player going second will tap his clock to start the other player's clock. After making a play, each player will tap the clock on his side to stop his clock and start his opponent's clock. A smaller timer is shown at the bottom if each player's clock showing how long he has been on his turn.</p>
<p>In order to challenge a play, the challenger will press the gavel icon. This will automatically pause the clock and open the Word Judge screen. After adjudicating a play, press back twice to return to the clock, and start the appropriate clock.</p>
<p>To pause the clock any other time, press (don't hold down) the red button in the center.</p>
