<h2>Two Steps</h2>
<p>This is a quick focus on card boxing as done in the Hoot app. See the Help screen for general
  help with Hoot.   The idea behind card boxes is repeated study, testing.
  It is a proven way to study words without a lot of wasted time going over
  words you already know. Two steps are involved.

<ul>
  <li>Add words to a card box</li>
  <li>Take a card box quiz</li>
</ul>

  Depending on how you study, there is an intermediate step you could take to actually study (Review) the
  words before quizzing yourself on them, though it seems many people study as they test.
</p>

<h3>Add Words to a Card Box</h3>
<p>You create a card box by doing a search.
  When the search is complete and the words are displayed, long press on the results to display a context menu. At the
  top of the menu is the option to Add to Card Box...
  Select that and then select Anagrams. That adds all of the cards in the results to the Anagrams
  database.
Another option is to use lists, but more about that later.
</p>
<h3>Take a Card Box Quiz</h3>
<p>Secondly, you have to go to the Card Boxes item in the Options Menu (three dots). When the Select Cardbox menu is displayed Anagrams is already displayed as the type of card box. press Quiz to begin. That opens up the screen with the first anagram displayed. You can shuffle or alphabetize the tiles with the buttons on the left. To form your answer select the letter tiles. When all tiles have been selected the entry is submitted. If correct it will be added to the list. Remember that this is an anagram, so there may be more than one word. The bottom right of the screen shows how many words are correct/possible. When all the correct words have been entered a green check is displayed to go to the next word. If you don't know the words, press the eye on the right to see all of the correct answers. The best way to learn how to use it is to do a few simple exercises using real short lists.</p>
<p><strong><em>Exercise 1 </em></strong></p>
<p>Search: Select Pattern, enter FL?X, and search. <br>
Long Press and Add to Card Box... &gt; Anagrams<br>
Quiz: Go to Card Boxes in the options menu, select Anagrams (default), and press Quiz.</p>
<p>As you go through the exercise you will see the stats at the bottom left. This shows what anagram you are on and total, the current box number and the current schedule date. After it has been graded, the new box number and next scheduled date will be displayed there.</p>
<p><a name="options" id="options"></a></p>
<h2>Options and Settings</h2>
<p>While you can stick to this system, there are many options that you may want to consider.</p>
<p>In normal operation, Hoot calculates the next scheduled date and primarily uses that order, starting in the lowest box number first. Schedule first, then box number. In the card box screen, there is an option to take quizzes in <strong>cardbox order</strong>. In that case it goes through all cards in the lowest box number before going to the next box number. Below that is the option to randomize. <strong>Randomize</strong> shuffles the order of cards
  that are scheduled near the same time (within a 10 hour
  span). Without randomize the cards within a card box appear in the same order each time and may
  be too predictable, especially if added in alphabetical order. Take the quiz by tapping the letters (Anagrams), or typing them in the keyboard. When you provide all the
correct answers, the Arrow button displayed takes you to the next item. The third option on this screen lets you decide <strong>number of questions</strong> you want in your test. You can change this here and you can change the default in Settings. Finally, you can <strong>filter</strong> the cards you want to test on at the bottom. This helps if you have several thousand cards in the card box but you only want to study 5 letter words for example.</p>
<p>Other options for card boxes are in Settings. Going to the main search screen, select Settings from the Options menu. At the bottom are Slide and Quiz Options. </p>
<h3>Flashcard mode</h3>
<p>By enabling flashcard mode in Settings you can speed through cards faster. In this mode you
  mentally find the answers to the quiz, then tap the list area to show the correct answers.
  Swipe up to register it as correct or swipe down to register it as incorrect. Be careful not to
attempt to scroll by swiping; use the scrollbar..</p>
<p><strong>Auto advance</strong> in Quiz goes to the next question after you have entered all answers. </p>
<p><strong>Default number of cards</strong> changes the number that displays on the card box
  screen. You can <strong>show hooks in quizzes</strong> instead of just the words. Some folks use
  this to study
other words during the test. Loop in Slides and Keep screen on are primarily for slide shows.</p>
<p>Try another test using the options and settings you think you might find useful.</p>
<p><strong><em>Example 2</em></strong></p>
<p>Search Anagrams Q??<br>
Long Press and Add to Card Box... &gt; Anagrams<br>
Quiz: Go to Card Boxes in the options menu, select Anagrams (default), and press Quiz.</p>
<p>Now when you go to the card box screen you should notice the statistics for the card boxes. While cards are scheduled, Hoot doesn't prevent you from going ahead of schedule. In the future you may want to pay attention so you can select how many you want to test on. If you only want to study the ones in box 0, select Cardbox order and  enter that number in the number of questions. Otherwise, Hoot will go through the new cards for that scheduled date along with words you got wrong the first time (box 0), then the words you got right (box 1+).</p>
<h3>Filter and Merge</h3>
<p>When selecting a card quiz you can now filter the card box to study a subset of the cards.
  Enter search criteria at the bottom, check the box, and select either Quiz or Review. Keep in
  mind that only those words that are in the card box will be shown if you had previously added
  them. Using the filter doesn't change the order in which they are presented.</p>
<p>You can now also merge words in a list card box into the respective standard card box. That
  adds the correct count, box number, and sets the scheduled date to the latter of both card
  boxes. So you can use a list to study RETINA? anagrams until you have learned them and then
  merge them into Anagrams with the other words. Merging doesn't change when they were scheduled
  to be tested again.</p>
<p><strong></strong><a name="lists" id="lists"></a></p>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>In addition to the standard card boxes, Hoot has another option called Lists. This is a standalone card box for a specific study. To take a list card box quiz, Select Lists instead of the default Anagrams. When you do
  another option exists  below it to select the list you just created. </p>
<p><strong><em>Example 3</em></strong></p>
<p>Search Length &gt; 2 letter words<br>
  Long Press and Add to Card Box... &gt; Lists<br>
  Select Anagrams (default) and enter a description like &quot;Two Letter Words&quot;.<br>
  Quiz: Go to Card Boxes in the options menu, select Lists, select the list name, and press Quiz.</p>

<p>It works just like a
  standard card box but  it is separate. With this card box there is another option. After you've
  studied  the list for some time you may want to add these cards to the standard card box. You can
  do that with the <strong>Merge List cards</strong> into Anagrams. It carries over the box number and scheduled date. So you can use a list to study RETINA? anagrams until you have learned them and then
merge them into Anagrams with the other words. </p>
<h3>Last Words</h3>


<p>In addition to Anagram card boxes, there are also Hooks and Blank Anagrams. Also, the Card box system is only one of several word study tools in Hoot. Word slide shows, Anagram
  Reviews, and Quick Quizzes are a few other ways you can study words. </p>
