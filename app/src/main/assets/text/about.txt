Hoot desktop companion
------------
This app is a companion to the desktop program Hoot Lite. Using the desktop version you can create databases with additional lexicons that can be used in the Android app.
Importable lexicons and Databases are available for download from the website www.tylerhosting.com/hoot/downloads.html, including ENABLE (early Words with Friends) and ODS5 (French).
The desktop version also lets you create your own lexicon from a plain text word list.


About Me . . .
I am a programmer with experience with numerous languages and most of my programming was before I got a degree in the computer science field.
I entered the field in the 1980's, about the time the PC (personal computer) was first made readily available.
Since then, I've written in various versions of Basic, Visual Basic, C, Pascal, Java, and other languages.
I also design websites and am familiar with HTML, CSS, PHP, Perl, ASP.NET, Javascript, and others. I've also done a lot of other computer type things. I didn't get a computer degree until 2012.

Before starting this project, C# was one of the languages I was least proficient in. I decided to develop this application in C# after I didn't get a C# programming job I had applied for.
At the time I was just getting more interested in word games so I decided to make this my C# training project.
I also have a degree in accounting, having written a tax accounting book or two, and do some graphic design.
You can see my website, blog, and outdated resume, at www.tylerhosting.com/dbell/ and send me an email using one of the contact forms. For recreation, I also enjoy playing disc golf.
